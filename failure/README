# Failure Traces

Failure Traces define when failures occur, how long they last, and their intensity. Failure Traces are defined using parquet. This folder provides all tools to create new Carbon Traces. [failure_example.py] shows how to create a simple Carbon Trace from a Pandas DataFrame. 

The traces folder contains 37 Carbon Traces collected for the Cloud Uptime Archive paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09476. 

When using these traces, please reference it accordingly.
