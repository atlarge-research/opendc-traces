This repository contains information regarding all traces used by the [OpenDC](https://github.com/atlarge-research/opendc) framework. In this repository, users can find many traces used in previous works, and scripts to generate new traces. 

Three types of traces are used:

- *Failure Traces:* are used to inject failures during OpenDC simulations. 

- *Carbon Traces:* are used to calculate the Carbon Emissions of data centers

- *Workload Traces:* Define the tasks OpenDC should execute, and when.
